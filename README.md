# Traffic simulation on the wordpress site

This project seeks to generate artificial traffic from a Kali Linux machine to a website hosted on a Debian server using the Apache Benchmark (ab) tool. Additionally, monitoring tools will be implemented on the server to detect traffic surges and evaluate its performance.

## üå± How to start a project?


### Local Installation:
Clone the repository to your local environment [repository](https://github.com/breatheco-de/traffic-simulation-on-wordpress) and follow the instructions in the README file.


### Requirements

To carry out this project, we will need 2 virtual machines. One will be the Debian virtual machine where we previously built the WordPress website, and the other will be the Kali virtual machine as the attacker.

* Oracle VirtualBox
* Virtual machine with Kali Linux (Attacker): To generate traffic.
* Virtual machine with Debian (Web Server): Where we have the Apache server and the WordPress site hosted.

## üìù Instructions

### Step 1: Configure the Network in VirtualBox

#### Configure the Network of the Debian Machine (Web Server):
* Open VirtualBox.
* Select your Debian virtual machine and click on "Settings".
* Go to the "Network" section.
* Ensure that "Adapter 1" is enabled and set to "Bridged Adapter".
* En el campo "Nombre", selecciona el adaptador de red f√≠sica que deseas usar (el que tu host est√° utilizando para conectarse a la red, como Wi-Fi o Ethernet). Esto suele ser algo como "Intel(R) Ethernet Connection" o "Wi-Fi".
* Save the changes and close the settings window.


#### Configure the Network of the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker):
* Select your Kali Linux virtual machine and click on "Settings".
* Go to the "Network" section.
* Ensure that "Adapter 1" is enabled and set to "Bridged Adapter".
* In the "Name" field, select the same physical network adapter you selected for the Debian machine.
* Save the changes and close the settings window.
